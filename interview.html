				<h3>Interview 1: Megan Davis</h3>
				<b>1. Who are you? What do you do?</b>
				<p>I am Megan Davis that goes to Anderson University and majors in English. I am graduating in two years
					in the year 2024. So I am a student so all that I really do is read and write since I am an English
					major and don’t work since you focus on my studies.</p>
				<b>2. Have you ever volunteered with an organization that focuses to bring awareness to a creative
					medium like glass?</b>
				<p>No, I have not volunteered focused on art mediums, rather I have volunteered occasionally at my
					church with helping the little children in need as well as volunteering during the Christmas season
					as a Santa helper.</p>
				<b>3. What past experiences led you to take time out of your day to volunteer?</b>
				<p>Growing up in the Christian church and being a believer, helped me see the importance of giving back
					to the community. As Christians, we are called to follow Jesus’s example of serving and loving
					others. I also grew up volunteering when I was connected with clubs that focused on serving the
					community.</p>
				<b>4. How did volunteering at the organizations impact you?</b>
				<p>I was able to help other people and It made me feel like I was impacting the world positively as well
					as becoming a better Christian. Nonprofit organizations need support in order to thrive and make an
					impact in the world and in our community.</p>
				<b>5. What’s your personal view on glass as an art medium?</b>
				<p>Looking at art as a medium brings me back towards stained glass and churches however glass is not the
					first thought I have when thinking of an art medium, I personally first think of drawing or
					painting. However, glassblowing is a creative medium when looking into the details of how it is
					made.</p>
				<b>6. What matters to you about a website?</b>
				<p>I personally don't prefer to have too much information, I focus more on the visual appeal with a good
					balance of words. I also prefer easy navigation so there is no confusion when cruising through the
					website.</p>
				<b>7. How often do you make decisions based on a website’s look?</b>
				<p>I often based my decisions on a website's look since if money is a major play on the website, you
					have to be sure that the website is professional and secure before giving your money to the
					business.</p>
				<b>8. Do you usually go for visuals first or information?</b>
				<p>Probably the visuals since I see before I read which also helps me decide if I should stay on the
					website or search for another.</p>

				<h3>Interview 2: Elena Dosantos</h3>
				<b>1. Who are you? What do you do?</b>
				<p>My name is Elena Dosantos and I have been married for 24 years and have two kids and a dog. I am a 2nd
					grade teacher that teaches in a public school. So far I have been teaching for 22 years.</p>
				<b>2. Have you ever volunteered with an organization that focuses to bring awareness to a creative
					medium like glass?</b>
				<p>No, I have never volunteered with an organization that brings awareness to medium like glass.
					However, have volunteered with Salvation Army and an organization called Back to Back whose purpose
					is to help orphaned children.</p>
				<b>3. What past experiences led you to take time out of your day to volunteer?</b>
				<p>As a teacher and growing up in a Christian school I feel that one of our missions is to serve others.
					I also volunteered at an orphanage when I was young which really had a place in my heart to continue
					to volunteer to help my community. </p>
				<b>4. How did volunteering at the organizations impact you?</b>
				<p>It made me want to continue helping others and to continue volunteering since I was able to
					positively help my community especially with children.</p>
				<b>5. What’s your personal view on glass as an art medium?</b>
				<p>My first thought is that it is fragile and delicate like it could break when holding it in your
					hands. At first, I would not view it as an art medium since I typically view art mediums as
					painting, clay, and chalk.</p>
				<b>6. What matters to you about a website?</b>
				<p>What matters to me in a website is the ease of navigating around the whole website and the graphics.
				</p>
				<b>7. How often do you make decisions based on a website’s look?</b>
				<p> I would say I always base my decision on the appearance of the website because I don’t like to read,
					to me a picture speaks a thousand words. </p>
				<b>8. Do you usually go for visuals first or information?</b>
				<p>I would look at the visuals first since if there is too much writing I would probably overlook it and
					might even exit out of the website. .</p>
				<b>9. Would you let your students take a glassblowing course/class?</b>
				<p>No, that would be dangerous especially with the heated insturments and fire that is involved along with the danger of breaking the glass which is likely with my students.</p>

				<h3>Overall Takeaways</h3>
				<p>Looking at these two interviews, both a teacher and a student were primary users that fit in the user group of the UrbanGlass organization. Interviewing a teacher helped me see a viewpoint of an adult that is in charge of studnets and children especially with classes provided with pretty risky equipment that could be dangerous. It was a hard tiny getting a rid on Elena since alot of her answers were generic but comparing with the student that I interviewed, I was able to see that they both think alike and have some of the same viewpoints.</p>
				<p>After finishing the interview with Megan Davis, I got a lot of information on her thoughts of UrbanGlass especially since I could read her well which I believe wad since I was relatively her same age. I remember vividly that I asked if she would take a UrbanGlass class and she replied that she would but would be scared to try with the fangerous equipment that goes along with glassblowing.</p>
