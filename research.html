					<p>When I first started with research on the organization called UrbanGlass, I first started with researching the programs that they provide. The first one that I came across the school partnership with Greene Hill that has been collaborated since 2015. This after-school program is for middle schoolers are designed to build skills from one year and to the next by focusing on mosaics, stained glass, flameworking, and glassblowing.</p>
					<p>The next program that I came across when researching is called Teens Take The Met (TTTM) which is a biannual event that is hosted by the Met. The Met invites cultural institutions to create engaging hands-on activities and performances for ages 13-19. So UrbanGlass has been partnered with TTTM since 2017 by providing glass art making activities.</p>
					<p>I went away from programs and focused on scholarships and that I where I found the Bead Project. The Chelicca Bead Project is a scholarship program was designed for the creatively inclined women, and over the course of ten classes, the students learn the art of beadmaking. This project is able to offer students a brand new experience that is transformative.</p>
					<p>Turning back to community programs, I found the FGPC which is also known as the Fort Greene Park Conservancy. I was able to find out that UrbanGlass have been distributing free art activity kits which focuses on upcycling and the sustainability to the community neighbors which is able to inpsire a deeper consideration for the beauty of nature including the park.</p>
					<p>Afterwards I was able to find that UrbanGlass is included in pop-up markets, festivals, and fairs which helps the connection with local communities and is able to share the magic of glass. </p>
					<p>Lastly, in my research I come across the all all-ages programs which offers students of any ages the opportunity to explore the limitless possibilities of glass.</p>
