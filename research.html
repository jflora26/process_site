			<p>When I first started with research on the organization called UrbanGlass, I first started with
				researching the programs that they provide. The first one that I came across the school partnership with
				Greene Hill that has been collaborated since 2015. This after-school program is for middle schoolers are
				designed to build skills from one year and to the next by focusing on mosaics, stained glass,
				flameworking, and glassblowing.</p>
			<p>The next program that I came across when researching is called Teens Take The Met (TTTM) which is a
				biannual event that is hosted by the Met. The Met invites cultural institutions to create engaging
				hands-on activities and performances for ages 13-19. So UrbanGlass has been partnered with TTTM since
				2017 by providing glass art making activities.</p>
			<p>I went away from programs and focused on scholarships and that I where I found the Bead Project. The
				Chelicca Bead Project is a scholarship program was designed for the creatively inclined women, and over
				the course of ten classes, the students learn the art of beadmaking. This project is able to offer
				students a brand new experience that is transformative.</p>
			<p>Turning back to community programs, I found the FGPC which is also known as the Fort Greene Park
				Conservancy. I was able to find out that UrbanGlass have been distributing free art activity kits which
				focuses on upcycling and the sustainability to the community neighbors which is able to inpsire a deeper
				consideration for the beauty of nature including the park.</p>
			<p>Afterwards I was able to find that UrbanGlass is included in pop-up markets, festivals, and fairs which
				helps the connection with local communities and is able to share the magic of glass. </p>
			<p>Lastly, in my research I come across the all all-ages programs which offers students of any ages the
				opportunity to explore the limitless possibilities of glass.</p>

				<p>What did when digging a little deeper?</p>

			<b>1) Try to find recent innovations in your client’s particular area. They could be technological,
				behavioral, or cultural.</b>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="./UrbanGlass_Research/award_fellowships.jpeg" alt="award" /></span>The most recent innovation for this organization is on January 7th, 2022, UrbanGlass was awarded $10,000
					by the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA). This awarded 10,000 from the NYSCA Recovery Fund to
					the organization UrbanGlass will be utilized to ensure safety and further COVID-19 protocol within the
					organization’s studios, offices, and gallery spaces. So in the coming year of 2022, it will continue to
					bring change and UrbanGlass will play a vital role in the renewal of New York’s economy and creative
					ecosystem. "The arts have long been a critical sector in our economy, and as we continue to rebuild a
					stronger New York, it's essential we do all we can to help this industry thrive once again," shared New
					York State Governor Kathy Hochul. "These awardees represent the best of what New York's vibrant
					communities have to offer and with this funding in hand, they will be able to not only continue their
					creative and inspiring work but help spur revitalization in their own backyard as well."</p>


			<h4>Quote from UrbanGlass Executive Director</h4>
			<blockquote>“We are honored to receive this generous gift from the State of New York,” shared UrbanGlass Executive Director Devin Mathis. “Our organization plans to use these funds to fuel our COVID-19 recovery efforts, creating the safest environment possible for our artists, staff, and educators so they can continue to practice, create and innovate within the medium.”
			</blockquote>

			<p><span class="image right"><img src="./UrbanGlass_Research/Magazine_new_class.jpeg" alt="award" /></span>Another recent innovation is the press coverage on June 24, 2019, on the widespread of the ceramics craze that built steadily to its saturation point. This is another artisanal movement that has been swiftly gaining traction which of course is glassmaking. A surge of young glassblowers inspired by the studio-glass movement of the 60s is creating loopy glass straws and warped vessels that have found their way into hyper curated homewares shops far and wide. From this online magazine, they include the top three glassblowing studios in the New York area which include UrbanGlass. The other two that are stated after The Biggest (UrbanGlass) are The Most Specific (Brooklyn Glass) and The One With a Water View (Scanlan Glass).</p>

			<h4>UrbanGlass</h4>
			<blockquote>“Fort Greene’s UrbanGlass has been around since 1977 and was where Dale Chihuly worked in the 80s. Courses are taught by local artists and range from workshops (from $60) to intensives (from $890).”</blockquote>

			<h4>Brooklyn Glass</h4>
			<blockquote>“It’s all about the highly niche classes here: from a one-day apple-making workshop ($180) to a make-your-own-shot-glass class ($220) to a five-hour terrarium.”</blockquote>

			<h4>Scanlan Glass</h4>
			<blockquote>“Kevin Scanlan, a glassmaker who has shown work at the Museum of Modern Art and the Corning Museum of Glass, teaches beginner, intermediate, advanced, and private classes out of his waterfront Red Hook studio."</blockquote>
