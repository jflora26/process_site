				<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
				<p class="info">What is the problem you all are trying to solve? Trying to express the creative
					experimentation that the medium glass is.</p>
			</header>
			<p class="question">Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</p>
			<p>How might we show the understanding of the creative medium of glass?</p>
			<p class="question">Now, state the ultimate impact you are trying to have.</p>
			<p>We want to encourage experimentation and improve the knowledge of glassmaking.</p>
			<p class="question">What are some possible solutions to your problem? Think broadly. It is fine to start a
				project with a
				hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprising outcomes.</p>
			<p>Some possible solutions to the problem include taking lessons that allow students of all ages to discover
				the limitless potential of glass. Another solution is academic programs that run from beginner programs
				for kids of different ages to master classes for established artists.</p>
			<p class="question">Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing. They could
				be geographic,
				technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you are trying to reach.</p>
			<p>Because individuals including students are not in control when classes (UGH) are available to them, we
				want to address this problem to the cost of available classes. We want a solution that would work for
				any individual or student at any time.</p>
			<p class="question">Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</p>
			<p>How might we provide classes for all individuals and students at any time in order to exhibit the
				experimentation of the creative medium known as glass?</p>
