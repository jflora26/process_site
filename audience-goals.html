				<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
				<p class="info">Who is the audienece and what are the goals to accomplish?</p>

			<div class="box alt">

				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Thinking about the audinece lead to the use of sticky notes and creating groups which were called
				directly involved, peripherally relevant, fans, and skeptics. In the directly involved group, I added
				state governor, students, instructors, schools, members, the MET, and all women. In the peripherally
				category is the MET programs like TTTM, donor members, Brooklyn Glass, Scanlan Glass, Parents of the
				all-ages program. In the fans category was the MET, professionals, art community, studnents with
				scholarships, and consumers. The last category called skeptics has Brooklyn Glass, enviromentalists,
				parents of younger ages/studnets for safety reasons, and those with no knowledge on where their money
				would go.
			</p>

			<p>After creating the groups of directly involved, peripherally relevant, fans, and skeptics we then made
				new connections that made more groups which created a map of the people involved. The new groups were
				called give, receive, both, and taking the resources. What was placed in the give grouping wwas state
				governor, hosting organization actives at the MET, professionals, donations from members and
				instructors. What was placed in the receive grouping were students gaining scholarships, all women with
				the bead project, the art community, and schools. What was placed in the take resources grouping were
				those with no knowledge of where their money goes, enviromentalists, parents of children with younger
				ages, Brooklyn Glass, and Scanlan Glass. In the last grouping of both give and recieve was consumers,
				the MET, and parents apart of the all-age programs.
